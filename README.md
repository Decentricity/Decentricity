### Hi there 👋 Your friendly Blockchain girl here.

<!--
**Decentricity/Decentricity** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I was born in 1984 so I'm extremely leery of government overreach and faceless megacorporationa. This is reflected in the stuff that I do.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Degenics](http://degenics.com), which combines a privacy-first Blockchain with Bioinformatics.
- 🐼 I have a website, [Decentri.city](http://decentri.city), where I review decentralized and self hosted technologies you can use today. I am migrating it to [decentricity.github.io](http://decentricity.github.io) since it's ironic that the current site is on Google Sites 😂
- 🌱 I’m currently working at [Blocksphere](http://blocksphere.id) and [Asosiasi Blockchain Indonesia](http://asosiasiblockchain.co.id). I also cofounded [Blockchain Zoo](http://blockchainzoo.com)
- 👯 I’m currently learning Genomic Data Science and Blockchain.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help to make [Degenics](http://degenics.com) real.
- 💬 Ask me about Blockchain.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/wpandu) 
- 😄 Politics: Libertarian, Economic Conservative, Social Center-Left.
