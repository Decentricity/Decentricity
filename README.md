### Hi there 👋 Your friendly Blockchain girl here.

<!--
**Decentricity/Decentricity** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->
I was born in 1984 so I'm extremely leery of government overreach and faceless megacorporationa. This is reflected in the stuff that I do.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Degenics](http://degenics.com), which combines a privacy-first Blockchain with Bioinformatics.
- 🐼 I have a website, [Decentri.city](http://decentri.city), where I review decentralized and self hosted technologies you can use today. I am migrating it to [decentricity.github.io](http://decentricity.github.io) since it's ironic that the current site is on Google Sites 😂
- ❤️ I used to have several bots on Twitter and Facebook. Due to strange policies they put in place during the 2018 mid-terms and 2020 elections, all my bots were removed. This github backs them up in several repositories. If you speak Indonesian, check out [robotpuisi.github.io](http://robotpuisi.github.io), which was probably my most successful bot. It actually had several articles written about it. If you don't speak Indonesian, you can go to that page anyway since it actually has a Google Translate mode, or go to its English-speaking sisters: 
** [Future Dictionary Bot](http://robotpuisi.github.io/dict/index.html) 
** [Startups Bot](http://robotpuisi.github.io/startups/index.html)
- 🌱 I’m currently working at [Blocksphere](http://blocksphere.id) and [Asosiasi Blockchain Indonesia](http://asosiasiblockchain.co.id). I also cofounded [Blockchain Zoo](http://blockchainzoo.com)
- 👯 I’m currently learning Genomic Data Science and Bioinformatics.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help to make [Degenics](http://degenics.com) real.
